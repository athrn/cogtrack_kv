* x Connect game to game widget - gui/gamefactory

from kivy.tests.common import GraphicUnitTest, UnitTestTouch

* Better names for user interactions. user_match
  * Signal/slot
  * Send/receive

* Consider replacing all "include"s in kv files with load_file from python.
  * Every kv file has corresponding py file with load_file(__file__)
  * If b.kv depends on a.kv, b.py must include a.kv before loading b.kv
  * Pythons import mechanism will prevent double loading.
  * Some of Kivys path issues can be avoided.
  * Does not solve #:import of python stuff.

* Testing. base.kv not found if running pytest from root directory and not gui directory.
** Check out paths etc for finding kv files.

* kivy unittesting is a hack.
* x Use deprecated interactive launcher or something else?
  * Use something else...
* Gui testing
** Add games
** Save score


x Avoid import and include.
x Don't know why I can't import theme.py sometimes
x Sometimes base.kv isn't found or loaded multiple times...
x * Reconsider naming of TheApp/MainApp to avoid auto loading of kv file.
